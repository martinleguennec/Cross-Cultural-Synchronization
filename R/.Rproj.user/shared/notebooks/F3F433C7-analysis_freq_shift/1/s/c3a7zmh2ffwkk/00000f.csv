Max detuning represents the change in mean asynchrony for an increase in the maximum detuning of 1 Hz. The coefficients associated to a frequency represent the mean asynchrony at each frequency when the maximum detuning is 0. Coefficients shown with standard error, degrees of freedom, $t$-value and $p$-value. The model fit row shows marginal and conditional $R^2$ values."""
